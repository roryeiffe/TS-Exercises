/*
For this exercise, create an interface. The interface should have at least 
5 properties and at at least one optional property. Create an array and fill it with at
least 3 objects which fit the interface you created. Be as specific as possible when 
declaring variables (Give all variables a type and don't use the "any" keyword)
